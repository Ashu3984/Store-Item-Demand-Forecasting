# Store-Item-Demand-Forecasting
This project aims to forecast future sales of a store using ARIMA and Auto ARIMA models. The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data of various store items over a specific period

Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of the following columns:

date: The date of the sales record.
store_id: An identifier for the store.
item_id: An identifier for the item.
sales: The number of units sold for a particular item in a specific store on a given date.
The data spans multiple years and contains daily sales records for different items in different stores. The dataset is sufficiently large and captures potential seasonality, trends, and other patterns that can influence sales behavior.

Project Goal:
The main goal of this project is to build and compare ARIMA and Auto ARIMA models for sales forecasting. ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, and it is a popular time series forecasting model. Auto ARIMA is an automated version of ARIMA that helps in finding the optimal parameters for the model.

The specific steps of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the sales patterns, trends, and seasonality.
Train-Test Split: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
Model Building: Building ARIMA and Auto ARIMA models on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models on the testing data.
Forecasting: Generating future sales forecasts for a given time horizon.
Visualization: Visualizing the forecasted sales and comparing them with actual sales.
Conclusion:
Through this project, we aim to provide a reliable sales forecasting model that can assist the store in making informed inventory and stock management decisions. The ARIMA and Auto ARIMA models are widely used for time series forecasting, and the insights gained from this analysis can be used to improve the store's overall operational efficiency.
